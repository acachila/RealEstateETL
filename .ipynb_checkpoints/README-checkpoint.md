## Extraction
* We used 1 datasets from the public platform Zillow. All of our data was based on sales by per square foot through all the Zip codes ranging over various years from 2010 to 2019. These were the most recent ones we could find. The sources for our dataset are as follows
* We used one of the more popular search engines.

## Transformation 

* Our first steps in cleaning up the datasets involved figuring out which variables were not relevant.

## Load

* The last step was to transfer our final output into a Database. We created a database and respective tables to match the columns from the final Pandaâ€™s Data Frame using MYSQL and then connected to the database using SQLAlchemy and loaded the result.
